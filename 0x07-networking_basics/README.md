1. [OSI Model:]()
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computer network. It defines seven layers, each responsible for specific tasks in the process of data communication.

2. [Number of Layers in OSI Model:]()
The OSI model consists of seven layers.

3. [Organization of OSI Model:]()
The OSI model is organized in a hierarchical manner, from the lowest to the highest layer. The layers are interconnected, and each layer serves a specific purpose in facilitating communication between networked devices.

4. [LAN (Local Area Network):]()
A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographical area, such as an office building, home, or campus. LANs typically use Ethernet technology and are often owned and managed by a single organization.

5. [Typical Usage of LAN:]()
LANs are commonly used for sharing resources, such as files, printers, and internet connections, among the devices connected to the network.

6. [Typical Geographical Size of LAN:]()
The typical geographical size of a LAN can range from a small area, like a single room or a building, to several kilometers in size.

7. [WAN (Wide Area Network):]()
A WAN is a network that spans a larger geographical area, connecting multiple LANs or other networks together. It may include various transmission technologies like leased lines, satellites, or public internet connections.

8. [Typical Usage of WAN:]()
WANs are used to facilitate communication and data exchange over long distances, connecting offices or branches of a company in different cities or countries.

9. [Typical Geographical Size of WAN:]()
WANs can span large distances, from regional to global coverage, connecting devices across cities, states, or countries.

10. [The Internet:]()
The Internet is a vast global network of interconnected computers and servers that use standard internet protocols to communicate and share information worldwide.

11. [IP Address:]()
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, smartphone, router) connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

12. [Two Types of IP Address:]()
There are two main types of IP addresses: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6).

13. [Localhost:]()
Localhost refers to the loopback network address (127.0.0.1) of a device, allowing it to communicate with itself using the TCP/IP stack.

14. [Subnet:]()
A subnet is a portion of a larger network with a common address prefix. It allows for the segmentation of large networks into smaller, manageable parts.

15. [Reason for IPv6 Creation:]()
IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses due to the increasing number of devices and users connecting to the internet.

16. [TCP/UDP:]()
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two transport layer protocols in the OSI model, responsible for data delivery between applications.

17. [Two Main Data Transfer Protocols for IP:]()
The two main data transfer protocols for IP are TCP and UDP.

18. [Main Difference Between TCP and UDP:]()
The main difference is that TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented data transfer with error-checking and retransmission, while UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable data delivery.

19. [Port:]()
A port is a numerical identifier used to direct data to specific processes or services running on a device. Ports are part of the transport layer in the OSI model.

20. [SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers:]()
SSH (Secure Shell) - Port 22
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - Port 80
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) - Port 443

21. [Tool/Protocol to Check Device Connectivity:]()
The ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is often used to check if a device is connected to a network, commonly done through the "ping" command.
