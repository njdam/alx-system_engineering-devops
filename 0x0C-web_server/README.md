<center><h1>Web server</h1></center>

[A web server]() is a software application or a hardware device that serves as the foundation of the World Wide Web. Its primary purpose is to handle incoming requests from clients, typically web browsers, and respond by delivering web content, which can include HTML pages, images, videos, and other resources. Web servers play a critical role in making websites and web applications accessible over the internet.

...

<center><h3>Here are some key functions and characteristics of web servers:</h3><center>

1. ***Request Handling:*** Web servers receive incoming requests from clients using protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure). They process these requests and send back the appropriate response, which is often an HTML page or another type of resource.

2. ***Content Storage:*** Web servers store the web content and resources that they are responsible for serving. This content can be static (unchanging) or dynamic (generated on-the-fly based on user requests) and may include HTML files, images, scripts, stylesheets, and more.

3. ***Concurrency:*** Web servers are designed to handle multiple concurrent connections, allowing them to serve many clients simultaneously. This is crucial for accommodating a large number of users accessing a website at the same time.

4. ***Security:*** Web servers implement security measures to protect against common threats, such as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches. They often support secure communication using SSL/TLS for HTTPS.

5. ***Logging and Monitoring:*** Web servers log access and error information, providing valuable data for monitoring and troubleshooting. This information can include details about client requests, response times, and errors.

6. ***Load Balancing:*** In high-traffic scenarios, web servers may work in conjunction with load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, ensuring scalability and high availability.

7. ***Reverse Proxy:*** Web servers can act as reverse proxies, forwarding requests to backend application servers and handling tasks like SSL termination, content caching, and request routing.

[Note That:]() Common web server software includes Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and LiteSpeed, among others. These servers have different features, performance characteristics, and configurations, making them suitable for various use cases.

Web servers are a fundamental component of the internet infrastructure, enabling websites and web applications to be accessible to users around the world. They play a crucial role in delivering web content efficiently and securely.

<h4>1. Main Role of a Web Server:</h4>

A web server is a software application or hardware device that serves as the foundation of the World Wide Web. Its primary role is to receive and respond to requests from web clients (typically web browsers) by delivering web content, which is often in the form of HTML documents, images, videos, and other resources. Web servers ensure the availability and accessibility of websites and web applications to users over the internet. They handle various protocols, with HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) being the most common.


<h4>2. Child Process:</h4>

A child process is a term commonly used in computer science and operating systems to refer to a subprocess that is created and managed by a parent process. Child processes inherit certain attributes and resources from their parent process, and they can execute independently, performing tasks or running programs concurrently. Child processes are often used for tasks like multitasking, parallelism, and managing system resources efficiently.


<h4>3. Parent and Child Processes in Web Servers:</h4>

Web servers often employ a parent-child process model for various reasons, including:

* **Concurrency**: Handling multiple client requests simultaneously requires creating child processes to serve each request independently. This allows the web server to handle high traffic efficiently.

* **Fault Tolerance**: If a child process encounters an error or crashes, it won't affect the entire web server. The parent process can continue to manage other child processes, ensuring the server remains operational.

* **Resource Isolation**: Child processes can be isolated from each other, preventing resource conflicts and improving security.

* **Scalability**: Additional child processes can be created dynamically as traffic increases, ensuring the server can scale to accommodate more users.


<h4>4. Main HTTP Requests:</h4>

The main HTTP requests, also known as HTTP methods, are used by clients (such as web browsers) to interact with web servers. The primary HTTP methods include:

* `GET`: Retrieve data from the server, typically used to request web pages and resources.
* `POST`: S0end data to the server to be processed, often used for form submissions.
* `PUT`: Update or replace an existing resource on the server.
* `DELETE`: Request the removal of a specific resource on the server.
* `HEAD`: Retrieve only the headers of a response, useful for checking resource metadata.
* `OPTIONS`: Inquire about the communication options available for a resource.
* `PATCH`: Apply a partial modification to a resource.


<h4>5. DNS (Domain Name System):</h4>

DNS stands for `Domain Name System`. It is a decentralized naming system used on the internet to translate human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into numerical IP addresses (e.g., `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to identify each other on a network. DNS plays a crucial role in ensuring that users can access websites and services using familiar domain names instead of needing to remember numerical IP addresses.


<h4>6. DNS Main Role:</h4>

The primary role of DNS is to provide the following services:

* [Domain Name Resolution:]() DNS translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites and services by typing URLs.
* [Load Balancing:]() DNS can distribute traffic across multiple servers or data centers to improve performance and redundancy.
* [Redirection:]() DNS can be used to redirect requests from one domain or subdomain to another.
* [Email Routing:]() DNS is used for routing email by resolving mail server addresses for domain-specific email services (MX records).
* [Security:]() DNS can be used for various security measures, such as implementing domain-based security policies and blocking malicious domains.

[Note That:]() DNS is a critical component of the internet infrastructure, ensuring the seamless and efficient operation of web services and communication.

<center><h3>DNS Record Types</h3><center>

`DNS` (Domain Name System) uses various types of records to store and manage information associated with domain names. Here are some commonly used DNS record types:

<h4>1. A (Address) Record:</h4>

**Purpose**: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.

**Usage**: A records are used to associate a domain name (e.g., example.com) with the corresponding IPv4 address (e.g., 192.0.2.1). They are essential for routing network traffic to the correct server.


<h4>2. CNAME (Canonical Name) Record:</h4>

**Purpose**: Creates an alias for a domain name, redirecting it to another domain.

**Usage**: CNAME records are used when you want one domain name to point to the same location as another domain name. They are often used for creating subdomains or providing alternate domain names for the same resource.


<h4>3. TXT (Text) Record:</h4>

**Purpose**: Stores human-readable text data associated with a domain.

**Usage**: TXT records are versatile and can be used for various purposes, such as domain verification (for email services or webmaster tools), SPF (Sender Policy Framework) for email authentication, and providing arbitrary text information.


<h4>4. MX (Mail Exchanger) Record:</h4>

**Purpose**: Specifies the mail servers responsible for receiving email on behalf of a domain.

**Usage**: MX records are essential for email delivery. They point to the mail servers that should accept incoming email for a domain. Each MX record has a priority value, and email is routed to the server with the highest priority (lowest numeric value) first. If that server is unavailable, email is delivered to the next highest priority server.

[Note That:]() These are just a few of the many DNS record types available. DNS also includes records like NS (Name Server) for specifying authoritative name servers for a domain, AAAA records for IPv6 addresses, PTR records for reverse DNS lookups, and many more, each serving a specific purpose in managing domain name resolution and network services.
