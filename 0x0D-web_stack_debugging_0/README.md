# Web stack debugging #0

Debugging a web stack issue using Docker on Ubuntu 14.04 involves identifying and resolving problems related to a web application or web server running within a Docker container on an Ubuntu 14.04 host.

...

<h3>Here are some general steps and tips for debugging web stack issues in this environment:</h3>

<h4>1. To list docker containers:</H4>

* To list Docker containers running on your system, you can use the docker ps command. This command displays a list of running containers along with their details.
`docker ps`

* By default, `docker ps` lists only running containers. If you want to see all containers, including stopped ones, you can add the `-a` (or `--all`) option: `docker ps -a`

* To see only the IDs of running containers, you can use the `docker ps -q` command

* To see additional details about a specific container, you can use the docker inspect command followed by the container ID or name:
```
docker inspect <container_id_or_name>
```


<h4>2. Access the Container:</h4>

First, access the Docker container where your web application or server is running. You can do this using the docker exec command. Replace `<container_name>` with the actual name of your container.

```
docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
```
This command opens a shell session within the container, allowing you to inspect its configuration and logs.


<h4>3. Check Container Logs:</h4>

Examine the logs of the web server or application running within the container. Common log locations include /var/log or a location specified in your application's configuration.

```
tail -f /var/log/<log_filename>
```
Review the logs for any error messages or clues about what might be causing the issue.


<h4>4. Check Application Configuration:</h4>

Ensure that your web application's configuration files are correctly set up. Verify database connections, file paths, and other settings.


<h4>5. Test Network Connectivity:</h4>

Confirm that the container can connect to external resources and that there are no network-related issues. You can use `ping`, `curl`, or `wget` to test network connectivity.


<h4>6. Check Ports and Firewalls:</h4>

Confirm that the necessary ports are open in the container and that firewall rules are not blocking incoming or outgoing traffic. Use the `netstat` or `ss` command to check for open ports.

```
netstat -tuln
```

<h4>7. Check Dependencies:</h4>

Ensure that all required dependencies (e.g., libraries, databases, services) for your web application are installed and configured correctly.


<h4>8. Inspect Docker Compose Files (If Applicable):</h4>

If you are using Docker Compose to manage multiple containers as part of your web stack, review your Compose files (docker-compose.yml) to ensure that container interconnections and dependencies are correctly defined.


<h4>9. Check for Permission Issues:</h4>

Verify that file and directory permissions are correctly set within the container. Incorrect permissions can lead to issues with file access.


<h4>10. Update and Upgrade Packages:</h4>

If you suspect that the issue may be related to outdated packages, update and upgrade the packages within the container. Use the package manager (apt-get for Ubuntu) for this purpose.

```
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
```

<h4>11. Debug Web Server Configuration:</h4>

If you are using a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), check the server's configuration files for syntax errors and misconfigurations. Use the server's diagnostic tools to identify issues.


<h4>12. Test Manually:</h4>

Try to reproduce the issue manually by accessing your web application using a web browser or `curl` from within the container.


<h4>13. Collect Information:</h4>

Collect relevant information about the issue, including error messages, logs, and the steps you followed to reproduce the problem.


<h4>14. Search for Solutions:</h4>

Use search engines, forums, and community resources to look for solutions to common issues related to your web stack components.


<h4>15. Implement Fixes:</h4>

Based on your findings, implement fixes or adjustments to resolve the issue. This might involve modifying configuration files, installing missing dependencies, or applying patches.


<h4>16. Test Again:</h4>

After making changes, test your web application again to ensure that the issue has been resolved.


<h4>17. Document the Solution:</h4>

Document the problem and the steps you took to resolve it. This documentation can be helpful for future reference and for sharing knowledge with your team.


<h4>18. To Delete a Docker Container</h4>

To delete a Docker container, you can use the docker rm command followed by the container's ID or name.

* To delete a running container, you can use the `docker rm` command as follows:
```
docker rm <container_id_or_name>
```
Replace `<container_id_or_name>` with the ID or name of the running container you want to delete.

* To delete a Stopped Container, If the container is already stopped, you can still use the same docker rm command to delete it:
```
docker rm <container_id_or_name>
```

* To delete Multiple Containers at Once, You can delete multiple containers at once by specifying their IDs or names, separated by spaces:
```
docker rm <container1_id_or_name> <container2_id_or_name> <container3_id_or_name>
```

* To remove all stopped containers on your system, you can use the following command:
```
docker container prune
```
