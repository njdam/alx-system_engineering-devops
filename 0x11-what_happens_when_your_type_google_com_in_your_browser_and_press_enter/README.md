# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

When you type "google.com" in your web browser's address bar and press Enter, several things happen behind the scenes to load the Google website. Here's a simplified step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. ***DNS Resolution:***

Your web browser first needs to resolve the domain name "google.com" to an IP address. To do this, it sends a DNS (Domain Name System) query to your operating system's DNS resolver.


2. ***Local DNS Cache:***

The DNS resolver checks its local cache to see if it has the IP address of "google.com" stored from previous requests. If it's not in the cache or has expired, it proceeds to the next step.


3. ***Recursive DNS Server:***

If the local DNS cache doesn't have the information, the DNS resolver contacts a recursive DNS server (typically provided by your Internet Service Provider or a third-party DNS service like Google DNS). The recursive DNS server may have the IP address of "google.com" cached, or it will perform a series of lookups to find the authoritative DNS server for "google.com."


4. ***Authoritative DNS Server:***

The recursive DNS server queries the authoritative DNS server for "google.com." The authoritative DNS server is responsible for providing the correct IP address for the domain. Once found, this IP address is sent back to the recursive DNS server.


5. ***IP Address Resolution:***

The recursive DNS server returns the IP address of "google.com" to your local DNS resolver. The resolver then caches this information for future use.


6. ***Establishing a Connection:***

Your web browser now has the IP address of "google.com" and uses it to establish a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to Google's web servers on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).


7. ***Sending an HTTP Request:***

After establishing the connection, your web browser sends an HTTP request to the Google web server. The request typically includes information about the resource you're trying to access (e.g., the specific web page on google.com).


8. ***Receiving the Response:***

The Google web server processes your request and sends back an HTTP response. This response includes the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other resources required to render the Google homepage.


9. ***Rendering the Web Page:***

Your web browser receives the response and starts rendering the Google homepage. It processes the HTML to display text, images, and other content, while executing JavaScript to enhance the user experience.


10. ***Displaying the Web Page:***

The Google homepage is displayed in your browser, and you can interact with it.


[Note That:]() This is a simplified explanation of what happens when you enter a web address into your browser. In reality, the process may involve more steps, such as HTTPS encryption, content caching, and content delivery networks (CDNs) to optimize page loading speed. Additionally, web browsers have various optimization techniques to improve the user experience, such as preloading, caching, and rendering.
